Introduction:
The future of transportation, especially cars, will be driverless. Whether that future is 5 years or 20 years from now, a self-driving future enables additional unique interactions with consumers that smart businesses can take advantage of. Examples include in-vehicle advertising, entertainment, and experiences. 

Data Summary:
This data was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different self-driving scenarios including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then asks the person (the passenger within the self-driving vehicle) whether he/she will accept the coupon.

Objective:
Predict whether the driver will accept a coupon.

Current Progress:
Performed preliminary exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Checked variable type
Checked null values
Checked for class imbalance
Checked relationship between response variable and features

Next Steps:
Gain a better understanding of the features that contribute to customer accepting the coupons.
Perform extensive EDA.
